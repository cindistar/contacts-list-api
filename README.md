# App Overview
  
It's a Contacts List App getting data from / to API 
applying 4 http methods: get, post, put and delete.
I've also created a REST API JSON server in order to have my application running easily and I need
to mention it has a search bar as well.

# Packages

The app uses the following packages:
 
 - [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)
 - [uuid](https://pub.dev/packages/uuid)
 - [google_fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)

  # Note
  
  This application uses setState method for state management which is a built-in solution in Flutter.
